Periodic Flip

This is a memory game based around the first elements of the periodic table. 

Originally conceived to have the first 10 elements of the periodic table, I decided that I would create cards with 3 pieces of information about each element alongside the name - symbol, boiling point and melting point.

Reflecting the 3 pieces of information, each card would appear three times in the game. Each set of cards has a different colour background. I originally debated whether to follow a more traditional approach in the colours used for each reflecting the periodic table, but decided to choose colours as I went along instead.

Original plans were worked out with wireframes, and I wanted to keep things simple as the core focus was on the game element rather than designing something more complicated. Having 10 cards with 3 matches meant the set up would require 30 cards in total, meaning the grid would need to either be 5 columns and 6 rows or 6 columns and 5 rows.
