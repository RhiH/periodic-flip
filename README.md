Periodic Flip

This is a memory game based around the first elements of the periodic table. 

Originally conceived to have the first 10 elements of the periodic table, I decided that I would create cards with 3 pieces of information about each element alongside the name - symbol, boiling point and melting point.

Reflecting the 3 pieces of information, each card would appear three times in the game. Each set of cards has a different colour background. I originally debated whether to follow a more traditional approach in the colours used for each, reflecting the periodic table, but decided to choose colours as I went along instead.

Original plans were worked out with wireframes, and I wanted to keep things simple as the core focus was on the game element rather than designing something more complicated. Having 10 cards with 3 matches meant the set up would require 30 cards in total, meaning the grid would need to either be 5 columns and 6 rows or 6 columns and 5 rows. 

I decided I wanted the set up of the site to be written predominantly in JavaScript rather than creating it all in HTML, and only having the game functions in JavaScript. I watched a number of videos based on making match 2 games, to get an understanding of what I would need to include to create the kind of game I wanted to make. 

One key part was changing the number of matches from 2 to 3, as this was not covered by any of the videos I watched - I knew this would be something I would very much be on my own with. 

I decided to create the game by making it a match 2 cards to begin with to ensure my logic was sound, and then, once the functionality was up and running I would be able to amend the code to change it from 2 matches to 3. This was done at a later stage during the development of the JavaScript close to the end of making the game work.

I decided that other than creating the cards, I would hold off formatting the site until the functionality was completed. Styling the site would be one of the last stages of creating the site.
