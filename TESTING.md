## A Memory Game Featuring Periodic Table Elements ## 

**About the Testing**

During development testing, each stage was meticulously manually tested to ensure that the game's functionality and appearance were both working well. 

Originally the game was built as a match two game to ensure the functions worked, and following on from this code was amended to ensure that the original plan of the game being a match 3 game came to fruition. 

**Work in Progress**

* During the testing phases a specific class was added to the css as a place for any additional test styling - this was left in until a later stage, and was finally removed towards the end stages. It enabled me to have a place to work specifically with the styling and having a point of reference. This has now been removed from both the css and js files.

* While testing the responsiveness of the design I changed the background colors to show me the exact break points as I re-sized my screen, during this I discovered that I preferred having the different colour backgrounds on different size screens and consequently decided to make this a permanent part of the site.
